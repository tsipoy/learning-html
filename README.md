# HTML exercise 16: Final Project

You've learned a lot about HTML the past 3 weeks. Now it's time to share what you've learned. In this exercise, you need to create a website that can help others learn HTML.

- [What you'll be marked on](#what-youll-be-marked-on)
- [Some hints](#some-hints)

## Sections

The website will be broken up into the following sections:

- Elements
- Rules
- Tips

## Pages

We won't be creating all the possible pages in this website. Instead, we'll be building at least the following 6 example pages:

- Homepage
- List of all HTML rules
  - Nesting rules in detail
  - Attribute rules in detail
- List of all the HTML5 elements
- Tips for writing HTML

### The homepage

The homepage needs to:

- introduce the website to the user, explaining what the website is about
- have a brief description of HTML
- offer links to the various sections.
- finish off with your details as the author. How do people know who wrote this website? How can they get in touch with you?

### List of HTML rules page

There are many rules for coding or writing HTML. Try to list as many as you can, one sentence per rule.

Two of the rules need to be links to their own pages:

- The nesting rules
- The attribute rules

#### Nesting rules page

In this page, you'll need:

- a link back to the list of rules
- a heading, giving this rule a title
- a description of this rule
- a "Don't do this!" code example of nesting
- a "Do this instead" code example of nesting

#### Attribute rules page

In this page, you'll need:

- a link back to the list of rules
- a heading, giving this rule a title
- a description of this rule
- a "Don't do this!" code example of using attributes
- a "Do this instead" code example of using attributes

### List of all elements page

In this page, we need:

- a good title
- a definition of an HTML 'element' and what bits make up an 'element'
- a list of all HTML5 elements by element name

### Tips for writing HTML page

This page is a chance to get personal. Give your reader at least 3 tips on how to write HTML. Think:

- How to write HTML quicker
- What tools to use
- How to make sure your work is high-quality

## Getting started

1. Create a public repo called: `learning-html`, and add a `README.md`
1. Copy and clone the SSH URL for this new repo in a directory on your computer, preferably in `~/code/html`.
1. Create and push the `gh-pages` branch, and enable 'GitHub Pages' on that branch in the repo settings.
1. Add the URL for this website to the `README.md` file
1. Use `master` as your default development branch, only merging to `gh-pages` when you're ready to publish your changes.
1. Get coding!

## What you'll be marked on

Your project will be evaluated on:

- Your use of English (Spelling, Grammar)
- Your code cleanliness (Is it easy to read, and free of garbage?)
- Your use of HTML elements (Did you use the correct HTML element? Could you have used an HTML element where there is none?)
- Your Git commits, pushes, branch use.

You could also lose points if there are any:

- 404s for any of your links
- validation **errors** in the W3C validator. Warnings are OK.

## Some hints

- Try to be consistent
- Keep your HTML clean and easy to read
- Spell-check and proof-read your English
- Validate and test your work
- Do your URLs make structural and meaningful sense?
- Does your `README.md` contain details on how to develop and publish this website?
- Do you link to your own pages if you have a matching page for the subject you're talking about?
